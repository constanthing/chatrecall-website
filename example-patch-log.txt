0.0.6 - Dec 25. 2025

Revamped scraping process. Instead of using separate initailize buttons or initialize all sources button there is now only one scrape button. Checkboxes for each sources are used to determine what to scrape. Default all are selected.

Added:

Chat limit to scrapes (e.g. 5, 10, all)
Fixed:

duplicate chats being added when scraping process continues again
Changed:

look of scraping logs

0.0.7 - Dec 26th. 2025

Removed: - Initialize all sources button / Individual initialize buttons with checkboxes and one singular “scrape” button for better UX flow.

Fixed:
- Scraping chats duplicating in database.

Changed:
- Design of scraping logs box
    - Shows handy list of what’s next to scrape and more detailed logs.
- Entire scraping process (background.js) to be more modularized and easier to understand

Added:
- Stop scrape button to stop scrape directly within the page being scraped
- Date of last scrape for each source
- Chats limit option for scraping
    - No Limit, 5, 10, 50, 500
- Any chat you visit is now being scraped for its first 5 prompts
    - Supported chats: perplexity, gemini, chatgpt, and claude
    - Does not support dynamically adding created prompts. Will be available in next update.
- Basic prompt search based on tokens (letters/individual words)
    - Matched tokens are highlighted
    - Prompts with matched tokens are displayed directly under chat information (title, date accessed)
- Chat bubble button appears on chats that have prompts scraped. Click this button to view all of the scraped prompts for a chat.

0.0.8 - Dec. 26th 

Added:
- Support for dynamically saving created prompts to database.
    - Example supported workflows:
        - Switching between chats and creating prompts -> created prompts are saved
        - Moving from youtube.com to chatgpt.com and starting chat -> created prompts are saved
    - Before we only supported scraping prompts when an existing chat was visited. You’d have to refresh the entire page to save all the prompts of a chat.
